This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in MATLAB related to how the program handles empty arrays and implicit type conversion.  The `bug.m` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.m` provides a corrected version.  The issue arises from the implicit conversion of an empty array to a logical value when checking for emptiness. This can lead to unexpected program flow and potentially obscure errors.
